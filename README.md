# project-4

Hello !
I chose to write my code for my version of a breakout game using pygame ! It was my first time using python as you can see on my github profile, I've only coded in C++ and JavaScript before. I had a lot of fun using the pygame library and working on the project overall! 

You will find the code itself in the main.py file. The other three files are the png logos I drew on my iPad using clip studio paint. There's a logo for the game, a start button and a heart icon to illustrate lives count. The last file is the Pokemon like font I downloaded on dafont 

I hope you have fun with the game !
